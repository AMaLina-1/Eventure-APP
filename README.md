## Context Description
Our application provides a **one-stop event discovery platform** that helps users easily find `activities` they like. Instead of visiting multiple resources, users can search for activities through our unified interface. Our main features include:
- Allowing users to apply `filters` such as `date`, `theme`, and `region` to quickly find relevant activities.
- Providing a `save` option for users to save those activities they are interested in during a browsing session.
- Enabling a `like` feature that allows users to express interest in activities, and the system displays their popularity based on the total number of likes.
